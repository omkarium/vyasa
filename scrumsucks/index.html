        <h1 class="title">SCЯUM SUCKS: WHY THE WORLD'S MOST POPULAR 'AGILE' FRAMEWORK IS AN UTTER FAILURE</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p class="intro">
            In this post, I'm not here to bore you with definitions. I'm assuming you already speak the cult-like language of <strong>Scrum</strong>: <strong>Sprint</strong>, <strong>Velocity</strong>, <strong>Capacity</strong>, <strong>Story Points</strong>, <strong>Backlog</strong>, and the dreaded <strong>Events</strong>. You know the lingo, and if you're reading this, you probably also know the soul-crushing reality behind it.
        </p>

        <p class="intro">
            If you still genuinely believe Scrum is the salvation of software development, prepare for a rude awakening. I'm here to tell you why <strong>Scrum is an utter failure</strong> and how projects that adopt it are often destined for disaster, regardless of their "end state." The fact is, <strong>Scrum sucks</strong>. Just accept it.
        </p>

        <p class="intro">
            The biggest tragedy is that most teams aren't even doing <em>true</em> Scrum. They're doing "Scrum-but," a Frankenstein's monster of misused jargon and enforced ceremony. This distorted version sucks the life essence out of the workforce, quickly becoming a hostile playground where <strong>mid-level managers and Scrum Masters, utterly clueless about the technology and process, play god</strong>—a glorified delivery problem wrapped in a rigid, process-heavy bow.
        </p>

        <section class="problem">
            <h2>Problem 1: The Micro-Management Incubator</h2>
            <p>The greatest failure of Scrum is how quickly it becomes a <strong>fertile ground for micro-management to thrive</strong>. Scrum stops favoring features and product value and starts focusing obsessively on its process and the time-boxed nature of achieving things. You end up with process on top of process on top of process, all just to get a single feature out the door. Everything is reduced to a <strong>card to be ticked</strong> by the end of the sprint. But why?</p>

            <h3>The Daily Stand-Up: The Ritual of Mistrust</h3>
            <p>The primary reason is simple: the "Scrum management" essentially <strong>does not trust its core team</strong> to manage their own damn work. Because a small percentage of people can't self-manage, the entire team is subjected to the same ritualistic punishment: the <strong>Daily Stand-Up</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Three Questions are a Joke:</strong> We're supposed to answer: 1) What did you do yesterday? 2) What will you do today? 3) What will you do tomorrow? This forces the developer to <strong>pre-package their thoughts and plan a day in advance</strong> before making any meaningful progress today.</li>
                <li><strong>The 15-Minute Myth:</strong> The meeting is supposed to be no more than 15 minutes, but for some reason, it inevitably goes beyond 30 minutes, turning into deep-dive explanations of "why and how" from each team member, eating up everyone's most productive morning time. We're having <strong>meetings for the sake of meeting</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Backwards Timing:</strong> A stand-up at the very beginning of the day is fundamentally bad. Most developers need a moment to check logs, review yesterday's work, and get <strong>clarification from their leads or colleagues</strong> before they can provide a <em>meaningful</em> update. The early-morning stand-up forces you to give an update on a task that you haven't even properly started or planned for that morning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Echo Chamber of Retrospectives</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Retrospective</strong>—the theoretical cornerstone of continuous improvement—quickly devolves into an <strong>echo chamber</strong>. People are too afraid to talk about real, systemic change. Those critical discussions that <em>should</em> take place in a quick 5-minute side chat are intentionally pushed into a separate, agenda-driven meeting on the calendar sometime next week. Management claims we're being productive while making us the least productive and approachable people in the office.</p>

            <h2>Problem 2: Story Points and the Hostility of Estimation</h2>
            <p>Scrum becomes extremely hostile towards its team, especially when <strong>someone else decides the Story Points</strong> for a task that only the developer truly understands. It gets worse when:</p>

            <h3>The Story Point/Time Fallacy</h3>
            <p>The single most destructive and common mistake is when <strong>Scrum Masters and managers equate one Story Point to a fixed number of hours</strong>. You might have heard them say, "1 Story Point is equal to 4 hours." This is an absolute corruption of the entire concept.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Story Points are Relative Effort:</strong> A Story Point is supposed to be a <strong>relative measure of effort and complexity</strong>, not a timer! They look at past velocity and assume that number is a concrete, predictive constant for every future sprint, regardless of the work's nature.</li>
                <li><strong>Inaccurate Averaging:</strong> This metric becomes meaningless when teams are diverse (<strong>Problem 4</strong>). A task estimated at "1 Point" by a CRM developer might take them 4 hours, but the same "1 Point" task for an Integration developer might take 10. The team's <strong>velocity is averaged and normalized</strong>, making it an inaccurate, punishing metric for everyone.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Overloaded 'User Story'</h3>
            <p>The foundational unit of work, the <strong>User Story</strong>, is supposed to be small, testable, potentially deployable, and value-driven. In practice, a User Story suddenly becomes not just one feature, but a <strong>set of features</strong> that are all crammed to be "finished" within that single sprint.</p>
            <p>As an example, you get a 14-point story. That size itself is a red flag that it could be broken down. But it gets worse: the estimate rarely accounts for the inevitable <strong>external dependencies</strong>—the people up the ladder or operating in a different time zone that you are waiting on. If a dependency stops you, the story spills over. The original Story Points don't change, and it's <strong>portrayed as the developer’s mistake or incompetence</strong>. When you build a product with such concrete, inflexible rules that resist change, <strong>quality rapidly deteriorates, and teams crumble under pressure</strong>.</p>
            <p>Agile is supposed to nurture creativity and flexibility. <strong>Scrum, as practiced, chains its users in an invisible jail</strong> driven by a myriad of arbitrary processes and rules with little to zero scope for actual flexibility or creativity.</p>

        <section class="problem">
            <h2>Problem 3: The Ill-Equipped Scrum Master</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the most baffling decision in the Scrum process is electing <strong>Scrum Masters with little to no knowledge of their teams' tech stack, capabilities, or SLDC</strong>.</p>
            <p>Their only goal is to <strong>get a story/card ticked ASAP</strong> while simultaneously over-promising to stakeholders, often when they absolutely don't need to. To them, it's all about <strong>velocity, the burndown chart, and vague metrics like story points</strong>, all in a frantic effort to normalize people and performance into mere data points on a sheet.</p>

            <h3>Competition, Not Collaboration</h3>
            <p>They champion those who finish tasks quicker, creating an artificial sense of competition and stress, rather than fostering curiosity, quality, and delight in the work. <strong>This is not right.</strong> Not everyone is made equal. Some people take more time than others, and the complexity of work varies wildly. If everyone is expected to work at the same velocity, why do we even pretend to have things like "competitive pay" or performance reviews? The framework is used as a **blunt instrument to manage people**, not a flexible tool to manage work.</p>

        <section class="problem">
            <h2>Problem 4: Scrum's Resistance to Change (The Irony)</h2>
            <p>Scrum boasts that it is a <strong>revolutionary agent of change and adaptation</strong>. The painful, ironic truth is that, in practice, it becomes <strong>incredibly hard to implement fully and rapidly becomes very much against any <em>real</em> change</strong>.</p>
            <p>Any deviation from the process, even if it demonstrably improves speed or quality, is flagged as "not being Scrum." Instead of inspecting and adapting to the team's needs, the team is forced to adapt to the framework's dogma.</p>
            <p>This is the ultimate paradox: a framework claiming to embody agility that, through its rigid, dogmatic application by ill-equipped practitioners, forces teams into a state of <strong>organizational paralysis</strong>.</p>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <p>You might wonder, isn't this all just <strong>bad management, incorrect usage, and poor implementation</strong>?</p>
            <p>Yes, it is. But when the system is so easily, so widely, and so consistently abused to become a tool for micro-management and performance policing—as 90% of implementations demonstrate—the problem is no longer the user. <strong>The problem is the product itself.</strong> The fact that the official framework is so easily corrupted into a nightmare scenario is its most damning indictment.</p>
            <p>Teams and organizations which follows Scrum do not deserve to claim they are the best. They are living in their self created La-La Land.</p>
            <p>If you disagree with me, I encourage you to search "why scrum sucks" on the internet. You will find thousands of examples and stories from people who passionately support this argument. Now, if you'll excuse me, my supposedly 15-minute stand-up is about to start... for the third time this week although I know exactly what to do for the next few days and the uncertaininty it takes to tick the card to <em>DONE</em>. I guess Scrum is all about giving assurances to our <b>Masters</b> on a daily basis that there nothing is wrong with us lot for 45 mins everyday and yet somehow we purposely manage to not account that lost time into our story points estimations.</p>
        </section>
        <hr>
        <p>Here are a few comments of people from only a single Youtube video who had enough dealing with this nuisance on a daily basis</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Scrum is a process where you provide the arsenal in the retros to your masters to shoot yourself (probably me).</li>
            <li>Scrum is about making software development like a car manufacturing assembly line. There is no end to its torture.</li>
            <li>In my company, sprints are treated like two week deadlines, so I often do free, hidden overtime Java developer to deliver, because of that.</li>
            <li>That's what happens when you let sales people and HR to manage software projects.</li>
            <li>My problems with SCRUM - voting because in every team good engineers are fewer and they are outvote - daily stand-ups and completely useless.</li>
            <li>Scrum turns software development into an assembly line. It’s the fast foodification of software development. Quality doesn’t matter. Just go fast! How many units did you complete this sprint? You better do the same or better next sprint or we’ll PIP you! Nothing has killed my enjoyment of development more than scrum. I’d rather farm dung at this point.</li>
            <li>It’s a cargo cult process.</li>
            <li>Scrum breaks the natural flow of highly productive software engineers. If you're doing Scrum and you find it hard to attract good software engineers then you only have yourself to blame.</li>
            <li>My team is using scrum, our PO cares more about story points than the actual product. He comes in like a wrecking ball putting in comments what is already described in the user story but with incorrect grammar. There’s no big picture, user stories are vertical slices, every user story can’t be longer than a couple of days if they are then they must be broken up. There’s no collaboration developers are encouraged to collaborate but doing so forces you to fall behind on your tasks. Refactoring at first was encouraged but now it’s frowned upon. From “refactoring  is part of scrum” to “why didn’t you do it right the first time”.</li>
            <li>"it falcilitates micromanagement and it allows management not to manage"
I'd describe scrum as "it allows for developers to not be constantly managed", I don't know how your scrummasters have fucked up scrum so royaly that you feel you are being micromanaged while the managers also aren't doing any managing..</li>
            <li>scrum is awful, if you're a developer and you can't live like this long-term, reporting every morning what you have done with your pants down in front of the team for years on end.</li>
            <li>I have a software company. I only use scrum if the customer requires it. If i have full control over my project and want the best results i NEVER USE SCRUM. It is a terrible waste of time.</li>
            <li>Scrum is for a war room situation, meaning something really went wrong, you get your top experts into a team, you sort it out, once it's done, you end the scrum. Going back to more related approached.</li>
            <li>The project will take the time it will take, you can invest now when things are simple or you can push things through on a deadline and continually pay bad technical debt forever.</li>
            <li>I feel burned out from scrum setup. Right on everything, team leads and scrum masters non developers that are task masters. They goal is to simply not have a story roll-over. Developers and QA pulling late nights late in the sprint to avoid bad metrics. Daily standups are pointless, your right your scared to say the same thing 3 days in a row. Then there is the useless meetings, meetings about meetings to prepare for meetings to decide if something is 5 or 8 points. Scrum masters and team leads serve no purpose, just middle management. Better off letting seniors handle that work.</li>
            <li>yes, yes, yes .... and more yes!  Nothing has harmed the productivity and pleasure I (and many) devs used to manifest every day happily coding away than freaking SCRUM.  Yuck.  Younger devs are seriously confused when I tell them that there once was a long-ago where there was nothing like regimented shame-fests led by know-nothings called 'stand-ups' or that requirements weren't written in some stultified pseudo story' language for some bizarre reason and that we had far fewer layers of oversight and far fewer hours of our week were spent on meaningless busy agile-related bull ... and that we wrote software that worked and we met client expectations and budgets and we had a great time doing it.  Now its all one giant anti-pattern called 'agile' and we are just cogs in the wheel.</li>
            <li>"It creates a conveyor belt" --> Because it is a method that strives to reduce engineers from skilled labor, to unskilled/less skilled factory cog type labor.  It was created during a time when there was a shortage of actual engineers.  Actual engineers have no issues with deriving requirements and creating accurate estimates.  Two items often characterized by scrum advocates as "impossible to overcome, so we agile".  And, to their credit, for pseudo-engineers, it is indeed impossible to overcome.  So, require less skill in requirements analysis and estimation science, and all of a sudden, you have WAY more eligible candidates for jobs.</li>
            <li>For me scrums biggest problem is it removes ownership from what is being delivered. Developers no longer feel a sense of ownership and as such are not motivated to deliver something of value that they are proud to be associated with. Passion and productivity nose dive as a project becomes atomised and disconnected. It becomes a vapid production line of box ticking to please people who have no real idea what is actually happening.</li>
            <li>What I've experienced is that in current Scrum there are too many people trying to justify their roles and making developers suffer. I am surprised SM is even a job. Have only seen them doing Jira and asking devs what they've done yesterday. Just useless and painful. Also BA who takes months to write BR... not understanding their product, just want to scream. Lots of these useless people get 1 day certifications and connect themselves to software development to earn money but bring no value... I am wondering how long will companies pay these meaningless jobs??? It is just getting ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Back  after a year :)  I was thinking about scrum for the past year and I think we all forget one important thing. Scrum allows and actually encourages non-technical people to be directly involved in development process. It is ok for upper management to be non-technical, but development teams should be led by lead/senior devs and not by non-tech PO/SM. I am talking about scrum in practice, not some theoretical "self-organizing teams" story.
This is like me being a manager of a team of lawyers. How could I possibly be able to organize their work, help them, measure their performance and be involved in decision making process without being a lawyer myself? I can maybe work in upper management but I can't directly lead them. 
The same as car workshop. When I want to repair my car I speak to master mechanic who probably has 10 years of experience as mechanic and he is in charge of mechanics team so to say, but in software industry I would speak with some salesman type of guy (PO) who doesn't really understand the development process, what I am asking and what can be done.</li>
            <li>I’d be interested in seeing what percentage of developers who experience “burn out” were working under scrum or scrum-like framework. In my experience, scrum means zero autonomy. You are always under the looking glass. Your worth as a developer is based on metrics and not outcomes. Even though the scrum guide does not say sprints are deadlines, too many (almost all) managers see them as one. Did you do 99% of a 20 point ticket? You have failed. It’s all based on a failed premise that software engineers can estimate their work when we can’t.</li>
            <li>Ironically, this goes against the "The true measurement is working software" part of the manifesto. It has flipped to measuring by story points, velocity, burn-down charts, endless sprints. Doesn't matter software is working perfectly fine, all that matters is that XL-shirt story hanging somewhere.</li>
            <li>As Gandhi once said, “I like your Scrum Guide, but I do not like your Scrum Masters. Your Scrum masters are so unlike your Scrum Guide.”</li>
